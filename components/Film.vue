				My first short “Three Dates” was about an ethnically ambiguous man facing judgement from his dates when they discover his true ethnicity. I used comedy to point at possible stereotypes attached to particular ethnicities. Three Dates, was screened at the 2013 New York Indian Film Festival. This short film led to the creation of Random Fox Productions.
